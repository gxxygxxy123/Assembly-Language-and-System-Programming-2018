# Assembly-Language-and-System-Programming-2018
Professor: 黃世強
It's a course about x86 assembly language and system programming.
The homework 3 and the final project are written with x86 assembly language and OpenGL(C++). The OpenGL part has already been written by the professor. All I have to do is the x86 assembly part.
Other homework and the quizzes are all written by only x86 assembly language.
